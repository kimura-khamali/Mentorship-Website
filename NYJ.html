        <h3>Summary of Born a Crime</h3>
        <p>
          The main characters in Chapters 1 and 2 are a colored boy and his
          mother, Patricia. The colored boy is Trevor, who narrates the
          story of his life in the book.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In Chapter 1, the boy recalls an incident from his childhood where his
          mother pushed him out 
          a moving car, which emphasized their relationship and the
          <br> challenges
          they faced during apartheid. Despite the hardships, they share
          moments of laughter and defiance against societal norms.<br />
          They display different themes such as religion, racism, and a sense of
          resilience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Chapter 2 introduces Patricia's relationship with a German/Swiss man,
          Robert, breaking
          societal roles for black individuals. Patricia's defiance <br>leads to the
          birth of a 
          child, whom she struggles to protect from being taken away. The
          narrative explores the complexities
          of race, identity, and societal <br>expectations in the colonial era in
          South Africa. This was during the apartheid period when blacks were
          denied the
          right to their freedom and had to follow the <br>white man's rule. As
          Trevor grows older, he questions his identity, longing to be Swiss.
          However, Patricia reveals his South African identity by blo,
          confronting <br>the duality of his existence. The themes of racial
          dynamics,
          defiance against norms, and identity exploration shape the narrative,
          highlighting the struggles and resilience <br>of individuals living under
          the legacy of apartheid.
        </p>

          In real life, one must overcome many obstacles and learn to be
          resilient to avoid being pushed down by others. Abiding in Religion is
          key
