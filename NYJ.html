        <h3>Summary of Born a Crime</h3>
        <p>
          The main characters in Chapters 1 and 2 are a colored boy and his
          mother, Patricia. <br />The colored boy is Trevor, who narrates the
          story of his life in the book.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In Chapter 1, the boy recalls an incident from his childhood where his
          mother pushed him out <br />
          a moving car, which emphasized their relationship and the challenges
          they <br />faced during apartheid. Despite the hardships, they share
          moments of laughter and defiance against societal norms.<br />
          They display different themes such as religion, racism, and a sense of
          resilience.
        </p>

          Chapter 2 introduces Patricia's relationship with a German/Swiss man,
          Robert, breaking<br />
          societal roles for black individuals. Patricia's defiance leads to the
          birth of a <br />
          child, whom she struggles to protect from being taken away. The
          narrative explores the complexities<br />
          of race, identity, and societal expectations in the colonial era in
          South Africa. This was during the apartheid period when blacks were
          denied the<br />
          right to their freedom and had to follow the white man's rule. As
          Trevor grows older, he questions his identity, longing to be Swiss.
          <br />However, Patricia reveals his South African identity by blo,
          confronting the duality of his existence. The themes of racial
          dynamics,<br />
          defiance against norms, and identity exploration shape the narrative,
          highlighting the struggles and resilience of individuals living under
          the legacy of apartheid.
        </p>

        <p>
          In real life, one must overcome many obstacles and learn to be
          resilient to avoid being pushed down by others. Abiding in Religion is
          key
